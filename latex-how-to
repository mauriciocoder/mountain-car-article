### I have configured latex with the following tutorial:

1) Download and install TEX by following (https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html): 

TeX Live - Quick install for Unix
If you don't want to bother reading the full install documentation and just want to install everything in TeX Live, on a Unix-like system, a minimal recipe follows.

For macOS (and MacOSX), we recommend installing MacTeX, which contains all of TeX Live (and a few Mac-specific additions).
Cygwin users can follow the instructions for Unix-like systems, but make sure you have the Cygwin prerequisites before beginning the installation.
Other Windows users: please consult the TeX Live on Windows page instead.
For more details on the commands given here, just keep scrolling down this page.

tl;dr: Unix(ish)
Non-interactive default installation on anything but Windows:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
cd /tmp # working directory of your choice
wget https://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz # or curl instead of wget
zcat < install-tl-unx.tar.gz | tar xf -
cd install-tl-*
perl ./install-tl --no-interaction # as root or with writable destination
Finally, prepend /usr/local/texlive/YYYY/bin/PLATFORM to your PATH,
e.g., /usr/local/texlive/2023/bin/x86_64-linux
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

I have added to PATH by eidting the file ~/.bashrc:
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/texlive/2023/bin/x86_64-linux



2) Installed the following plugin in the VS code:

3) Created a new folder for the project with a template file of extension .tex. This is your article.


4) Compiler asked me to include the file simpleConference.sty in the project folder. 


Enjoy typing in VS code!!
